## 🧮 Calculator

## Overview:

Calculator is a browser-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations through a simple, user-friendly interface. The project focuses on event-driven logic, accurate calculations, and synchronizing application state with the UI using vanilla JavaScript.

## Features:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Clear and reset functionality

Responsive button-based interface

Real-time display updates

## Tech Stack:

HTML5 – structure and layout

CSS3 – styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) – application logic

How to Run Locally

## Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/baconlord102/calculator.git

Navigate into the project directory

Open index.html in your browser

No setup or dependencies required.

## Application Logic:

Button presses trigger event listeners

Input values are stored and evaluated in application state

Arithmetic operations are handled through conditional logic

The display updates dynamically after each interaction

## What This Project Demonstrates:

Event-driven programming

Handling user input and edge cases

Synchronizing UI with application logic

Implementing basic algorithms in JavaScript

## Future Improvements:

Add keyboard input support

Improve error handling (division by zero)

Add calculation history

Enhance UI accessibility

## Purpose:

This project was built to practice core JavaScript logic and reinforce event handling patterns in a familiar problem space.
